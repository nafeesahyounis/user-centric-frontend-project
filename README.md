<p>This project is a website for a model, Agnes Krupka, based in Prague (Czech Republic). The website will act as both a visually stimulating resume of her work in the past, which centres around her existing portfolio of photographs, and a point of contact for clients to book her for future projects.</p>
<p>It is essential that the overall design of the website complements her photos and provides a clean, modern and professional feel as this will emphasise her versatility and visual appeal as a model. The website will also serve the purpose of providing her with more exposure and clients will be impressed by the eye-catching visuals, so they will see her as an ideal fit to push their campaigns to the next level. The website features an ‘About Me’ page so that the client can get to know her a bit more and the experience will be more personalised. There is also a Contact/Questions page that will give the client the opportunity to get in touch and discuss potential projects. The primary goal of the website is to visually demonstrate Agnes’ talent to potential clients whilst simultaneously providing them with an easy point of contact so that they can book her and discuss further details with ease.</p>
<p>The business goals of this website are:</p>
<p>-To build a brand and define her particular style of modelling.</p>
<p>-To provide high quality examples of her photoshoots and demonstrate her versatility as a model.</p>
<p>-Build rapport with potential clients via the contact page. This, in turn, will increase her network and provide her with more bookings.</p>
<p>-Beautiful, clean and professional looking UI so that the client can immediately visualise how her photos can both enhance and complement their campaign. </p>
<p>The customer goals of this website are:</p>
<p>-Searching for the ideal model for their campaign/photoshoot/show.<p>
<p>-Easy and intuitive means of establishing contact and discussing details for future project. Exact pricing is not provided as it will depend on the nature of the work and it will be necessary to discuss this with the client in further detail.</p>
<p>-Easy access to the model’s previous work so that they can quickly and seamlessly gauge whether or not she is the correct fit.</p>
