<h2><b> Testing</b></h2>
<p> The validity of the code and potential errors were checked for both HTML and CSS using the following validators:</p>

<p> <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation </a></p>
<h2><b>Testing client stories from UX section of README.md </b></h2>
<p>1)As a potential client and a business with time-constraints, I can immediately see beauty and full body shots of Agnes, so I can gauge if she has the overall look that I am searching for.</p>
<p> i) The landing page immediately provides the client with both beauty and body shots via an easy to navigate carousel</p>
<p> ii) A link for the Portfolio page is located both on the carousel and navigation bar, so if the client wishes to see more he/she can navigate quickly to the portfolio. </p>
<p>2)As a potential client, I have easy access to her bio and so I can determine whether or not her character and work ethic fits with our team.</p>
<p> i) A call to action button is located on both the landing page and the navigation bar that will take the customer to the About Me page, so the customer can learn more about her with ease. </p>
<p> ii) A short quote and a short, concise introduction about Agnes is also located on the landing page, so if the customer is in a rush they will be able to gauge something about her personality as well as see her pictures immediately on the landing page without needing to navigate to the rest of the site. </p>
<p> 3)As a new visitor to the site, I can easily and intuitively navigate between the pages, so I donâ€™t waste time searching for things.</p>
<p> i) Call to Action buttons are located on The Home Page and About Me page. </p>
<p> ii) The Navigation bar is in a clear font at the top and it toggles on a mobile view, so it is very intuitive to use. </p>
<p> iii) According to convention, the logo links back to the Home Page. </p>
<p> iv) The site has been tested by a few users and they have all remarked that it is very easy to move from one page to another. </p>
<p> 4)As a potential client, I have immediate access to her existing body of work so I can determine how well she photographs and how versatile she is.</p>
<p> i) There is easy and intuitive navigation that leads to Agnes' photos in the Portfolio via the HomePage. </p>
<p> ii) There is at least one photograph on each page other than the Portfolio. </p>
<p> iii) There is a carousel on the Home Page, which immediately gives the client a snippet from her Portfolio. </p>
<p> 5)As a potential client, I am able to access her social media (instagram and facebook), so that I can do further research and keep up-to-date with her existing projects if I so wish.</p>
<p> i) There is a footer on each page that navigates to both her Instagram and Facebook profiles. </p>
<p> 6)As a potential client, I can see who she has already worked with, so that I get a better idea of her level of experience.</p>
<p> i) There is some information of the Portfolio page for each picture that outlines who she has worked with. </p>
<p> 7)As a potential client and a business, the overall layout of the website enables me to visualise how her photographs can be translated into a broader campaign, so I am able to gauge if I can use them in a professional capacity to fulfil my particular need.</p>
<p> i) Muted, neutral colours were chosen for the site in order to make it look clean and to draw attention to the photos.</p>
<p> ii) The design of the website was made based on careful analysis of existing portfolios of photographers including <a href="https://www.kaylafisherphotography.com/"> Kayla Fisher </a> and <a href="https://www.mareenfischinger.com/"> Mareen Fischinger </a> and the conventions they used to make their websites appealing to existing clients, as well as emphasise how their work can be translated into a broader body of photographs. </p>
<p> iii) A limited number of elements were placed on each page during the design process to ensure that the focal point would be the photographs. </p>
<p> iv) Photographs were displayed both as a collective (the carousel and the Portfolio gallery) and as individual shots (The About Me and the the Contact Page). The purpose of this was to show the client how the photographs could be translated into different contexts, and to demonstrate their versatility. </p>
<p> 8)As a potential client and a business with time constraints, I can use the contact form quickly and intuitively in case I wish to get in touch with her and discuss anything further.</p>
<p> i) It is easy to navigate to the Contact Form via the navigation bar. </p>
<p> ii) There are only 3 required fields on the contact form, and so the User Experience is fast and does not require too much typing. </p>
<p> iii) The form follows an intuitive and conventional layout (Name, Surname, email address and message). </p> 
<h2>Manual (logical) testing of all elements and functionality on every page.</h2>
<h3> Home Page </h3>
<p> 1) Navigation Bar </p>
<p> - Firstly, I entered the Home Page on a desktop. </p>
<p> - Secondly, I clicked on each Navigation menu item and checked that it went to the correct page. </p>
<p> - Thirdly I used the developer tools to check the site on both a Mobile and Tablet Device. I also checked each link on actual Mobiles and a Tablet to make sure each item went to the correct page. </p>
<p> - Initially there were overflow problems on the mobile and tablet version. Some of the images on the page were resized in order to fix this. </p>
<p> - Initially the Navbar was not clear enough and the font was too small, so it was difficult to see it on a smaller screen size. The font was changed and the background of the Navbar was also changed to 'dark' using a bootstrap preset as opposed to its initial transparency, which made it difficult to view. </p>
<p> - Logo was clicked and as expected it took the client to the Home Page. </p>
<p> 2) Carousel </p>
<p> - Carousel was refreshed multiple times on desktop, mobile and tablet to ensure that it smoothly transitioned between the three pictures. </p>
<p> - The slider on the carousel was clicked for each picture to ensure that it took the user to the correct picture. </p>
<p> 3) Animations on carousel, entry of text and images </p>
<p> - The page was refreshed on Mobile, Tablet and desktop to make sure that the Animations worked.</p>
<p> 4) About me Mini Section text & image, and Quote Section text </p>
<p> - The text and images for these two sections were tested on different screen sizes using the developer tools. This was to ensure that they looked appealing and stood out regardless of screen-size. </p>
<p> - The colour of font and font choice was changed multiple times in order to ensure that the most eye-catching font colour and font style was selected. </p>
<p> 5) Call To Action Button leading to About Me Page and 'View Portfolio'</p>
<p> - The View Portfolio link and 'Learn more About Me' button were clicked on different devices to ensure that they were working properly. </p>
<p> 6) Footer </p>
<p> - I hovered over the footer and as expected the colour changed on desktop but not on Mobile and Tablet. The icons also smoothly navigated to the correct social media pages. </p>
<h3> About Me Page </h3>
<p>1) Navigation Bar </p>
<p> - Testing from the Homepage section was repeated on all three devices. </p>
<p> - Code was checked to ensure that it is identical to the Home Page. </p>
<p>2) Page Image </p>
<p>3) Page Content </p>
<p>4) Animations </p>
<p>5) Call to Action Buttons </p>
<p>6) Footer </p>
<p> - Testing from the Homepage section was repeated on all three devices. </p>
<p> - Code was checked to ensure that it is identical to the Home Page. </p>
