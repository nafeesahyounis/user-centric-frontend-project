<h2><b>Testing client stories from UX section of README.md </b></h2>
<p>1)As a potential client and a business with time-constraints, I can immediately see beauty and full body shots of Agnes, so I can gauge if she has the overall look that I am searching for.</p>
<p> i) The landing page immediately provides the client with both beauty and body shots via an easy to navigate carousel</p>
<p> ii) A link for the Portfolio page is located both on the carousel and navigation bar, so if the client wishes to see more he/she can navigate quickly to the portfolio. </p>
<p>2)As a potential client, I have easy access to her bio and so I can determine whether or not her character and work ethic fits with our team.</p>
<p> i) A call to action button is located on both the landing page and the navigation bar that will take the customer to the About Me page, so the customer can learn more about her with ease. </p>
<p> ii) A short quote and a short, concise introduction about Agnes is also located on the landing page, so if the customer is in a rush they will be able to gauge something about her personality as well as see her pictures immediately on the landing page without needing to navigate to the rest of the site. </p>
